# Solarized Dark Unified JetBrains IDE Theme

Like many of you, I spend and inordinate amount of time in front of my IDE. For me that's the JetBrains suite. So I tend to get quite nerdy and very picky about the color theme I stare at daily.

My absolute favorite for the past years has been the ` Solarized Dark` theme.

But I kept getting frustrated with not liking some aspects of the available Solarized themes on the JetBrains Marketplace.

Mainly the fact that the UI shades are always different from the Editor ones.

For me that's too much visual clutter and obstruction, as it distracts me noticeably when I need to switch the focus of my eyes very fast from the Editor to the Terminal or the Project file list.

I like my setup to be unified and simple, with low cognitive overhead and as little distractions as possible. As you can see in the screenshot, my setup is super stripped down, with all tool panels deactivated, no bottom notifications, the compact UI chosen etc.

So I published my own theme, created by adjusting an existing `Solarized Dark` theme to make it more `Unified`.

You can install it from within any of the JetBrains IDEs by going to the `Marketplace`
section in `Settings/Plugins` (Shift + Shift and search for **Plugins**). It is called `
Solarized Dark Unified` and is published under my name `Alex Ragalie`.

Alternatively, you can find it [here on the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22728-solarized-dark-unified).
